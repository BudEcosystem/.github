## About Bud Ecosystem
We are an AI research company specializing in multimodal generative AI. We build tools that simplify access to AI and break down the technical and financial barriers that prevent organizations and individuals from using it.

#### What We Build

- **Bud AI Foundry** : A control panel for your GenAI deployments, designed to maximize infrastructure performance and give you full control over every aspect, from deployment administration to compliance and security management—All in one place.
  
- **Bud Models** : A collection of GenAI models including LLMs, SLMs, Diffusion models, Code models. Some of them deliver SOTA performances. are pre-trained/finetuned for domain specific use cases.
-  **Bud Runtime** : A universal, self-healing runtime supporting diverse AI architectures (LLMs, STT, OCR, etc.) across CPUs, GPUs, and HPUs. It auto-tunes deployments for performance (0.3x–4x speedups) and ensures stable, zero-config scaling.
-  **Bud AI Gateway** : A high-performance, multi-modal AI gateway. It offers <1 ms latency for 10K+ QPS, supports 200+ model providers, self-optimizes via feedback, and cuts costs by up to 40%.
-  **Bud Sentinel** : A security and compliance suite for AI systems, featuring zero-trust model governance, <10 ms guardrails, 300+ probes, and confidential computing . It ensures robust protection for models, prompts, and infrastructure.
-  **Bud Scaler** : Automates scaling of AI resources across clouds and hardware, optimizing for cost, uptime, and compliance. Features include SLO-aware routing, distributed KV caching, and disaggregated compute for maximum ROI.\
-  **Bud Studio** : A collaborative GenAI builder platform allowing users to create, share, and deploy agents, tools, and prompts. It includes enterprise-grade RBAC/SSO, OpenStack integration, and AI-in-a-Box offerings for CSPs.
-  **Bud Agent & Tool Runtime** : A production-scale runtime for AI agents and tools, featuring MCP orchestration (400+ MCPs), agent PaaS, and secure, scalable deployment. It enables composable agent networks with built-in guardrails and artifact sharing.
